Stock price prediction RNN
In this work, we will predict the stock prices. The data is obtained from Kaggle for AT & T stock 
prices from 2000 to 2020. We will extract data, identify any inconsistency, missing data, 
outliers in data, clean and pre-process data and then predict future prices using multiple 
linear regression, Lasso, Ridge and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and try to regularise 
model to make it robust. Our objective is to predict the stock price based on previous prices. 
The price of stock for last few days will be feature vector to predict next day price.
